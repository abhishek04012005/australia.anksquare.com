### 7. Dynamic Parameters Strategy

To manage static generation while keeping build times reasonable:

```typescript
// Always generate (affects ~2,100 pages)
mainServices (3) × all cities (~700) = 2,100 pages

// Popular marketplace services (affects ~2,800 pages)  
amazon, flipkart, meesho, shopsy × all cities = 2,800 pages

// Limited to top 50 cities (affects ~600 pages)
website services (6) × top 50 cities = 300 pages
digital marketing services (6) × top 50 cities = 300 pages

// Fallback for other combinations
dynamicParams = true (allows on-demand generation)
```

### 8. Breadcrumb Navigation

Example: `/service/merchant-management/delhi`
```
Services > Merchant Management > Delhi, Delhi
```

Clicking through allows users to:
- View all services
- View service details without city
- Stay on city-specific page
